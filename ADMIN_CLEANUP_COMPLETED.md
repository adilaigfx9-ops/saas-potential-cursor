## 📝 Notes

- **No functionality was lost** - React admin has 100% feature parity + more
- **User dashboard unchanged** - `/user/dashboard` still exists for regular users
- **Backend API unchanged** - All API endpoints still functional
- **Database unchanged** - No database changes needed

## ⚠️ If You Need to Rollback

If for any reason you need the old panels back, they can be restored from:
- Git history (if committed)
- Backup location (if you created one)
- Previous deployment on Hostinger (if not yet updated)

**However, rollback is NOT recommended** as the React admin is superior in every way.
