# üöÄ Quick Start: Admin Panel Fix

## Problem
Admin panel shows: `Login failed: SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1 no such table: user_profiles`

## ‚úÖ Quick Fix (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Run Migration Script

**Via Browser (Easiest):**
```
https://your-domain.com/backend/migrate_user_profiles.php
```

**Via SSH:**
```bash
cd public_html/backend
php migrate_user_profiles.php
```

### Step 2: Login to Admin Panel

```
URL: https://your-domain.com/admin
Email: admin@adilgfx.com (or admin@adilcreator.com)
Password: admin123
```

### Step 3: Change Default Password!
‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Change the default password immediately after first login.
