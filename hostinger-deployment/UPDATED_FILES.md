## 🎯 Next Steps After Deployment

1. ✅ Verify all APIs are working (green status)
2. 🔐 Change default admin password
3. 🔑 Update JWT_SECRET in .env
4. 📧 Configure SMTP settings
5. 🗑️ Remove/secure test files
6. 🚀 Deploy frontend
7. 🧪 Test end-to-end functionality

---

## 💡 Important Notes

- **The previous "No response" errors were misleading** - they indicated the test method was broken, not your actual APIs
- Your APIs should work fine on production with these fixes
- Use `test-api-live.php` to verify everything is working
- All security best practices are included in the documentation
