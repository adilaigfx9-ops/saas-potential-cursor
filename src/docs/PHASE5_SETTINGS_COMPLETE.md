## 🏗️ Architecture

### Settings Categories
1. **General** - Site name, tagline, contact info, SEO
2. **Appearance** - Logo, colors, dark mode
3. **Profile** - Admin user profile and password

### File Upload Support
- Logo (up to 5MB)
- Favicon (up to 2MB)
- Avatar (up to 5MB)
- All uploads use existing `/api/uploads.php` endpoint

### Data Flow
```
User Input → React Hook Form → Validation (Zod) →
React Query Mutation → adminApi → Backend API →
Database → Success/Error → Toast Notification
```

### API Integration
- **GET** `/api/settings.php` - Get all settings
- **GET** `/api/settings.php/category/{category}` - Get by category
- **GET** `/api/settings.php/{key}` - Get single setting
- **PUT** `/api/settings.php/{key}` - Update single setting
- **PUT** `/api/settings.php/bulk` - Bulk update
- **GET** `/api/user/profile.php` - Get profile
- **PUT** `/api/user/profile.php` - Update profile
- **PUT** `/api/user/profile.php/password` - Update password
- **POST** `/api/uploads.php` - File uploads

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Authentication Required**
   - All settings endpoints require admin authentication
   - Profile endpoints verify user token

2. **Password Security**
   - Current password verification required
   - Minimum 6 characters enforced
   - Password confirmation matching
   - Passwords never exposed in responses

3. **File Upload Validation**
   - Type checking (images only)
   - Size limits enforced
   - Proper error handling

4. **Data Validation**
   - Email format validation
   - Required field enforcement
   - Type-safe API calls
