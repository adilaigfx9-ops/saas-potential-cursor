## 🏗️ Architecture

### File Upload Flow
1. User selects files via drag-drop or file picker
2. Client-side validation (type, size)
3. FormData preparation with metadata
4. Upload to `/api/uploads.php` endpoint
5. Server processes and stores files
6. Response includes file URL and metadata
7. React Query cache invalidation
8. UI update with new files

### File Types Supported
- **Images**: JPEG, JPG, PNG, WEBP, GIF
- **Videos**: MP4
- **Documents**: PDF
- **Maximum Size**: 10MB per file

### Data Flow
```
User Action → Component State → React Hook Form → Validation (Zod) →
React Query Mutation → adminApi.media → Backend API →
File Storage → Database → Success/Error → Toast Notification → Cache Invalidation
```

### API Integration
- **GET** `/api/uploads.php?page={page}&limit={limit}&type={type}` - Get media library
- **GET** `/api/uploads.php/{id}` - Get single file
- **POST** `/api/uploads.php` - Upload file(s)
- **PUT** `/api/uploads.php/{id}` - Update file metadata
- **DELETE** `/api/uploads.php/{id}` - Delete file

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Authentication Required**
   - All media endpoints require admin authentication
   - JWT token verification on all requests

2. **File Validation**
   - Client-side type checking
   - Server-side MIME type validation
   - File size limits enforced (10MB)
   - Allowed file types whitelist

3. **Access Control**
   - Delete operations require admin role
   - Update permissions verified
   - Proper error messages without exposing system details

4. **Data Safety**
   - Confirmation dialogs for deletions
   - No accidental data loss
   - Proper error recovery
