## Component Architecture Review

### 1. Service Layer (`api.ts` modifications) ✅

**Added Interfaces:**
```typescript
- PricingTier
- Service (complete with all fields)
- ServiceFormData
```

**Added Endpoints:**
```typescript
services: {
  getAll() - Fetch all services
  getById(id) - Fetch single service
  create(data) - Create new service
  update(id, data) - Update service
  delete(id) - Delete service
}
```

**Strengths:**
- Type-safe interfaces
- Consistent with Blog API pattern
- Proper error handling
- Nested data structures (pricing tiers)

### 2. Validation Layer (`validation.ts` modifications) ✅

**Added Schema:**
```typescript
serviceSchema - Complete service validation
```

**Validation Rules:**
- Name: 3-100 characters
- Tagline: 10-150 characters
- Description: 20-1000 characters
- Icon: Required
- Features: 1-15 items array
- Pricing Tiers: 1-5 nested objects
  - Each tier: name, price (≥0), duration required

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive validation
- Nested object validation
- Clear error messages
- Type inference for forms

### 3. Data Layer (`useServices.ts`) ✅

**Hooks Implemented:**
- `useServices()` - Fetch all with caching
- `useService(id)` - Fetch single (conditional)
- `useCreateService()` - Create mutation
- `useUpdateService()` - Update mutation
- `useDeleteService()` - Delete mutation

**Strengths:**
- React Query best practices
- Automatic cache invalidation
- 30-second stale time
- Consistent with Blog hooks pattern
- Proper error handling

### 4. UI Layer (ServiceList, ServiceForm, ServiceModal) ✅

**Form Complexity:**
- More complex than BlogForm due to:
  - Nested pricing tiers
  - Dynamic feature lists
  - Icon picker
  - Multiple sections
- Well-organized with Card components
- Maintains good UX despite complexity

#### ServiceModal Features ✅
