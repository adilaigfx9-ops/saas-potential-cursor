# Phase 10 – RBAC & Advanced Permissions - COMPLETE

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with four distinct roles and granular permission management.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Database Schema
**File:** `backend/database/migrations/rbac_schema.sql`

Extended the `users` table to support four roles:
- **User**: Default role for registered users (user portal access)
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to admin panel
- **Editor**: Create/edit content (blogs, portfolio, services)
- **Admin**: Full system access including user management

### 2. Backend API

#### Updated Files:
- `backend/classes/Auth.php` - Role included in JWT tokens
- `backend/api/user/profile.php` - Role in user profile responses
- `backend/api/admin/users.php` - NEW: User management API (Admin only)

#### API Endpoints:
```
GET    /api/admin/users              - List all users (paginated, searchable)
GET    /api/admin/users/{id}          - Get specific user details
PUT    /api/admin/users/{id}/role     - Update user role (Admin only)
DELETE /api/admin/users/{id}          - Delete user (Admin only)
```

#### Security Features:
- Admin-only access enforcement at API layer
- Audit logging for all role changes
- Automatic notifications when roles are updated
- Self-deletion prevention

### 3. Frontend Implementation

#### Type System:
**File:** `src/user/types/index.ts`
- Added `Role` type: `'user' | 'editor' | 'viewer' | 'admin'`
- Extended `User` interface with `role` field
- Added `AdminUser` and `UserListResponse` types

#### Authentication Context:
**File:** `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
Enhanced with role checking utilities:
- `hasRole(role: Role)` - Check if user has specific role
- `hasAnyRole(roles: Role[])` - Check if user has any of the given roles
- `isAdmin` - Quick admin check property

#### Route Protection:
**File:** `src/components/protected-route.tsx`
- NEW: Route guard component with role-based access control
- Displays clear error messages for unauthorized access
- Redirects to login when authentication required
- Applied to all protected routes in `App.tsx`

Protected Routes:
```tsx
/dashboard              → Requires: admin, editor, or viewer
/user/dashboard         → Requires: any authenticated user
/user/profile           → Requires: any authenticated user
/user/tokens            → Requires: any authenticated user
```

### 4. User Management Interface

#### Admin Pages:
**Directory:** `src/admin/pages/Users/`

**UserList.tsx:**
- Searchable, filterable user list
- Pagination support
- Role badges with color coding
- Quick actions: Update role, Delete user
- Display of user metrics (tokens, orders, join date)

**UserRoleModal.tsx:**
- Role assignment dialog
- Role descriptions for clarity
- Warning alerts for critical changes (admin grant/revoke)
- Confirmation workflow

**useUsers.ts Hook:**
- User list management
- Role updates
- User deletion
- Real-time refetch after mutations

### 5. Navigation Updates
**File:** `src/components/navigation.tsx`

Added authentication-aware navigation:
- **Not Logged In**: Login button + Hire Me CTA
- **Logged In (User)**: User Dashboard + Profile + Logout
- **Logged In (Admin/Editor/Viewer)**: Additional Admin Dashboard link
- Mobile menu includes all auth options

### 6. Audit & Activity Logging
**File:** `src/admin/pages/Analytics/ActivityFeed.tsx`

Extended to display:
- Role change events with Shield icon
- User management actions with UserCog icon
- All audit trail entries

## Security Measures

### API Layer:
1. JWT token verification on all protected endpoints
2. Role validation before processing requests
3. Admin-only enforcement for sensitive operations
4. Prevention of self-role-changes and self-deletion

### Frontend Layer:
1. Route guards with role checking
2. Conditional rendering based on permissions
3. Clear error messaging for unauthorized access
4. Session state management with role awareness

### Audit Trail:
1. All role changes logged with timestamps
2. Track who made the change and what changed
3. User notifications for role updates
4. Activity feed displays RBAC events

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Database migration applies cleanly
- [x] Auth API returns role in login/verify responses
- [x] User profile API includes role
- [x] Admin users API enforces admin-only access
- [x] Role updates work and trigger audit logs
- [x] Route guards block unauthorized access
- [x] Login button visible in navigation
- [x] Authenticated users see appropriate dashboard links
- [x] User management UI loads and functions
- [x] Role modal displays warnings correctly
- [x] TypeScript compilation succeeds
- [x] Production build succeeds

## Migration Guide

### Applying the Schema:
```bash
mysql -u [user] -p [database] < backend/database/migrations/rbac_schema.sql
```

### Setting Up First Admin:
```sql
UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your-admin@email.com';
```

### Testing Roles:
1. Create test accounts with different roles
2. Verify access restrictions at each level
3. Test role updates through admin panel
4. Confirm audit logs are created

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:
1. **Custom Permissions**: More granular permissions beyond roles
2. **Role Groups**: Organize users into teams/departments
3. **Time-Based Roles**: Temporary role assignments
4. **Multi-Factor Auth**: Additional security for admin accounts
5. **Activity Dashboard**: Dedicated RBAC analytics page
6. **Bulk Operations**: Assign roles to multiple users at once
